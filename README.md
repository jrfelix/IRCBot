# IRCBot
Small program that connects to an Internet Relay Chat as a client.

This program is written in Python. 

This IRC Bot can essentially connect to any IRC server, given that the right parameters 
are used.

Using the program is pretty simple. One only has to run the following command (command line):

      python botty.py
      

NOTE: It should go without mentioning that the IRC server needs to be running before the IRC Bot
        is executed.
        
        
Once the IRC Bot is running, it will begin listening for commands that start with a period "." .


The IRC Bot can be directly stopped with the command crtl + c, or it can be terminated by any other
client that types the command ".bye".
